# PSql.Deploy

PSql.Deploy is a simple, yet versatile database migration and seeding system
for SQL Server and Azure SQL Database.

- Write migrations and seeds in plain T-SQL.
- Run migrations and seeds with PowerShell commands.
- Supports zero-downtime deployment across multiple databases.
- SQLCMD-compatible – `GO`, `$(var)`, `:setvar`, and `:r` (include) work as expected.
- Diagnostics – see the entire batch that caused an error.
